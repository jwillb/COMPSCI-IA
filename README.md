Repository for my IB Internal Assessment

## What is it?
A simple program I made for my IB Internal Assessment to calculate the shrinkage of pottery. It uses SQLite and Tkinter (GUI).

## Quick Start
To use this program, clone the repo and run the main Python script, after installing the prerequisits with `pip`.
